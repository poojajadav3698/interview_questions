# Answers for the Questions

### Question 1
##### Please write a PHP function to print all files in one directory and all of its sub-directories.

I have created a sample answer for this and uploaded as question1.php. you can find this file in root directory.

### Question 2
##### Please write a PHP function(s)/class to automatic select command from:
      “/usr/local/imagemagick convert -limit memory 0 -limit map 0 -quiet /data/test.jpeg[0] -thumbnail @11000 -quality 50 /data/output.jpeg” on Linux
      
      “c:\tools\imagemagick.exe convert -limit memory 0 -limit map 0 -quiet c:\data\test.jpeg[0] -thumbnail @11000 -quality 50 c:\data\output.jpeg” on Windows
      
  #### Please also consider the performance of executing this command a few times in one process.
      
### Question 3
##### Can you provide 2 or 3 samples of PHP code that you are particularly proud of – and explain why – maybe it solved a difficult problem, maybe it was a unique way to work-around a limitation, maybe it was just something you finally worked out after many hours of frustration!
